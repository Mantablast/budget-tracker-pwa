## Installation
No installation should be required.  The data is saved within Mongo DB and the application has been deployed on Heroku.

## Usage 
When a user completes a daily financial transaction, they may enter the transaction into the tracker.  If the user receives funds, they can also add funds that have been dispursed to them.  If the app goes offline, the user should still be able to add transactions with the tracker and those transactions will be sent to the database when the app comes back online.
